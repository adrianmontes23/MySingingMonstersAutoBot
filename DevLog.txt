Gonna clean up code for good practice
Although code could be optimized,
i'm going to organize thats it
Part of reorganization will be 
moving all the images into a 
folder to make it look nicer

TODO
I would like to add an Avoid Island 
to stop this thing from checking on 
useless islands like composer 
Its a b but I saw a youtuber use 
another function to constantly detect 
where something is on screen so Ill do 
a while "not trigger maps" main loop then 
hit mirror button.

I changed the food thing to make it collect
all the food available on the screen off the
rip instead of each individual one and it 
runs through the food faster but it seems to
not work of its in the way of the food notifs
